# PRSice-paper-script
This repository contains scripts used for performing all analyses presented in the PRSice-2 paper (and extra). 


# Note
Please note that the scripts have been tailored to our server, which will require tweeking for them to work on other servers. 

Current version runs on an LSF server using the `/dev/shm/` to minimize I/O interferrance from other users on the server such that a more consistent and fair speed test can be performed.
